# Project Overview
This project is an AI-based recommendation system built using Java.
​
The system suggests products or content to users based on their preferences and historical interactions, making use of recommendation algorithms.
It can be implemented with libraries such as Apache Mahout or custom logic to demonstrate collaborative filtering or content-based filtering approaches.
​
The goal is to understand how recommendation engines work conceptually and how they can be integrated into Java applications with sample datasets.

# Features
Representation of users, items (products or content), and their interactions (ratings, views, clicks, or purchases).

Loading of sample data from files or in-memory structures to simulate user-item matrices.

Implementation of a recommendation algorithm that finds similar users or similar items and generates top-N suggestions for a given user.

Configurable parameters such as number of recommendations, similarity measures, or minimum ratings to consider.

Clear console output or logs that show which items are recommended and why, helping in understanding the recommendation logic.

# Tools and Technologies Used
Programming language: Java.

Libraries (possible options):

Apache Mahout for ready-made recommendation components, or

Custom implementation using standard Java collections for learning purposes.
​

Data storage: CSV or text files for sample user-item data.

Editor/IDE: IntelliJ IDEA for coding, running, and testing the recommendation logic.

# Project Structure (Example)
src/

Main.java – Entry point to run test scenarios and display recommendations.

RecommenderEngine.java – Core logic for computing similarities and generating recommendations.

models/ – Classes such as User, Item, and Rating.

data/ – Sample datasets used for testing.

# How to Run
Open the repository in IntelliJ IDEA and ensure Java is properly configured.

Add any required libraries (like Apache Mahout) using Maven, Gradle, or manual JARs.

Place sample data files into the expected data directory or configure paths in the code.

Run Main to generate recommendations for specific users and inspect the output.

# Real-World Applications
E-commerce platforms suggesting products based on previous purchases and ratings.
​
Streaming services recommending movies, series, or songs tailored to each user’s taste.

Content platforms (blogs, news sites) proposing relevant articles to increase user engagement.

Educational portals recommending courses or learning paths according to student interests and performance.

Any system that needs personalization to improve user experience and retention.
